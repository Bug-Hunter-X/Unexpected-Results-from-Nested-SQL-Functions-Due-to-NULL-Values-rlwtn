This repository contains a SQL query that demonstrates a common error related to NULL value handling within nested functions. The query uses nested functions to calculate a result, but it does not handle the possibility that an inner function might return NULL. This can lead to incorrect results or errors. The solution demonstrates how to properly handle NULL values using functions like `ISNULL()` or `COALESCE()` to avoid these issues.
